# Shadowing Server
##### FindShadowing.com is a website designed to help pre-medical students find shadowing opportunities in their areas. This application holds the server side resources for FindShadowing.com

###### The application is built using a serverless framework with [AWS lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). Lambda functions can be run individually via the command line but [API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html) orchestration is necessary for full backend function.
